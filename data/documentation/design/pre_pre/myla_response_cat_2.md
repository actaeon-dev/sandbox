Pt. 1

> > "i have another post to make from my notebook but before i go to bed i wonder if you have ideas about the mode of being the player character?

(Ambition is crazy cause its like, oh hey this is probably not that hard you can cut it back to make it less hard and then it just spirals. Its so fun. Actually fun i mean, not like fun where im being violently sarcastic)

"method of conveying this description" just means the way that the game world demonstrates and presents itself to [...]
